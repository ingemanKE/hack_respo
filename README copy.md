**Description:** This repository provides data and scripts to analyze the effect of invasive lionfish on native prey fish species across the Belizean Barrier Reef

**Contents:** One R script file, two data files and a README.md file.

**Scripts:** LF MS Model code.R: 
This script imports the two data files, runs mixed effects models to test the effect of lionfish on prey fish density (with appropriate covariates), and runs a permanova to test the effect of lionfish on comunity composition. This is the code for the analyses in the main text of the manuscript.

**Data:**  
  
* psData6.10.csv:  site-level data used in all the GLMs
* pData6.10.csv:  transect-level data used in the permanova
* psData0.5.csv:  site-level data with fish <5 cm used in the supplemental analysis
